I kept getting an issue where the value of key was correct, until scanf was called in the while loop.

I didn't write the C program, so no issues there

I used gdb to find that my create_key function was returning massive numbers, and found that it was because I didn't reset the values in the r8d-r11d registers before using them. 

Yes I did, I tried putting print statements in the c program along with the gdb I used prior to figure out where exactly my key value was being reset.
